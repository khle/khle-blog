This site is my `coding` journal. When I want to reflect on some major, "share-worthy" accomplishments, I blog on [medium](https://medium.com/@kevinle) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/codeprototype). But daily, as I overcome many "little" impediments, or learn something new, I'd like to keep and share them here, my journal.
